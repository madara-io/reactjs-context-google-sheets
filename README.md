# ReactJS Context and Google Sheets Database for tiny complet project

## Let me suggest an effective way to make a small project without a real database.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

```
"axios": "^0.18.0",
"bootstrap": "^4.3.1",
"react": "^16.8.6",
"react-dom": "^16.8.6",
"react-router-dom": "^5.0.0",
"react-scripts": "2.1.8",
"reactstrap": "^8.0.0"
```

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
